# BigCommerce Migration Hub

BigCommerce is a hosted platform often chosen by teams that want a structured catalog model and a commerce system that scales without managing infrastructure. Migration planning is frequently about catalog behavior: variant structure, option modeling, and the storefront experience for complex products.

### BigCommerce at a glance

**Core capabilities**

* Hosted commerce platform with strong catalog and operational foundations
* Variant modeling for products that have purchasable option combinations

**Typical strengths**

* Good for stores that want a hosted platform with a structured product model
* Strong for teams that want predictable operations and platform-managed infrastructure

**Common complexity drivers**

* Variant scale and the structure of option combinations
* Catalog behavior on complex products
* SEO continuity planning

BigCommerce documentation states that each product can have a maximum of **600 variants**.

### What tends to matter most in BigCommerce migrations

#### Variant structure and option modeling

BigCommerce supports variant-driven catalogs, but complexity increases when your option structure creates large variant grids. Even if your store fits within platform limits, you still want to confirm that the storefront behaves as expected for your most complex products.

#### Proof-first validation for complex products

BigCommerce projects benefit from early validation of the buying model: how customers choose options, how availability is represented, and how complex products appear in the storefront.

### How Next-Cart helps you reduce uncertainty

Next-Cart helps you validate the buying model early and interpret demo results based on outcomes, not only counts. If complex products need restructuring or special handling, it is better to discover it during a demo than during go-live pressure.

### Conclusion

BigCommerce is often a strong target when you want a hosted platform with structured product modeling and predictable operations. Migration success depends on proving that your option and variant model produces the storefront outcomes you expect, especially for the products that drive the most revenue. When you validate complex products early and align acceptance criteria with real buying workflows, you avoid the common trap of “data moved” without “store ready”.

You can validate direction through a **Demo Migration result**, especially using your most option-heavy products. If you prefer, you can **ask Next-Cart to run the Demo Migration using your sample data** and review the findings with you. If your store is close to variant scale limits or has complex option behavior, **Live Chat** is the fastest way to scope what needs special handling and choose the safest service level.
