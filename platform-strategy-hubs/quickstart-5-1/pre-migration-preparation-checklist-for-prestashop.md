# Pre-migration Preparation Checklist for Square

Preparation for Square primarily focuses on expectations and staff behavior, not platform configuration. The goal is to clarify scopes, reduce surprises, and create a demo that answers the biggest unknowns early.

### 1) Define success in outcomes, not only entity lists

Start with what must remain true after launch: browsing, purchasing behavior, support workflows, and marketing continuity. Then translate those outcomes into data scope categories (products/variations, categories, customers, orders, and key supporting content).

Use “decision makers” and “final approval owner” language internally, so it is clear who confirms acceptance criteria and when.

### 2) Identify Square-specific complexity drivers

For Square Online, the planning drivers that most often affect migration outcomes are:

* Product options and variation behavior (especially complex products)
* Modifier-style add-ons and custom product configuration
* Inventory expectations and how channel sync should behave
* Customer history expectations and how orders should appear in Square profiles
* Order-history interpretation (especially totals and cancellation/refund expectations)

### 3) Prepare a demo sample that reveals real risk

A Demo Migration is designed to give early clarity on mapping behavior and whether your store contains custom data that requires additional work. A strong sample includes best sellers, the most complex products, and a short list of priority URLs.

For Square specifically, include:

* A product with the highest option complexity
* A product that relies on add-ons or customization behavior
* A small set of representative orders that reflect your support and reporting reality
* A short list of URLs that must not break (if SEO matters)

### 4) Decide your SEO continuity ownership early

Migration SEO risk is often driven by URL continuity and redirect correctness. Square Online supports URL redirects, but has rules (such as one redirect per page) that can influence how you plan redirects.

If SEO is a major revenue channel, read **\[SEO and Traffic Continuity in Shopping Cart Migration]** before you finalize the scope.

### 5) Plan service selection around evidence, not anxiety

A demo is a scoping tool that helps you avoid choosing the wrong approach by revealing whether Standard, Managed, or Custom is the right fit for real complexity.

### Conclusion

Preparation is the part that prevents “late surprises”. For Square Online, the most important preparation work is clarifying how options and variations must behave, how historical orders should be treated operationally, and how URLs will remain reachable. If you define those expectations early, the project becomes more predictable and easier to validate.

Start by running a Demo Migration with a sample built for representative complexity, not random records. If you prefer, you can request that Next-Cart run the Demo Migration using your sample data and provide a structured results review.
