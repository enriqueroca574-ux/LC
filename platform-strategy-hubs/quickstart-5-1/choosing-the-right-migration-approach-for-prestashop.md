# Choosing the Right Migration Approach for Square

This page helps you choose between **Standard Migration**, **Managed Migration**, and **Custom Migration** for a Square Online target, based on the evidence your data provides.

### Start with the truth: demos reveal the real scope

A Demo Migration is not just a technical test. It is a scoping tool that helps you decide whether Standard, Managed, or Custom is the right fit for your store’s real complexity.

If you do not know where your “non-standard” data lives yet, a demo helps surface it early.

### When Standard Migration is often enough

Standard is usually suitable when:

* Your catalog is straightforward and variation behavior is easy to reproduce
* You have minimal reliance on third-party app data that must be preserved
* You can validate outcomes confidently with a defined checklist and sampling plan

Standard works best when demo findings show that your data maps cleanly into Square’s model without transformation logic.

### When Managed Migration is the safer choice

Managed is often the better fit when:

* You need stronger validation support and guidance
* Your data needs attention, cleanup, or deeper interpretation to preserve meaning
* Your team wants a clearer execution plan with fewer back-and-forth cycles

Managed Migration can provide deeper validation and guidance when your data needs more attention, and an experienced technician will handle the migration process for you.

### When Custom Migration is justified

Custom becomes necessary when preserving meaning requires transformation logic, selective handling, or special mapping beyond standard platform models. A demo often reveals these needs because standard mapping cannot migrate data the standard platform model does not expose cleanly.

If your Square migration involves sensitive order-history expectations or specialized product configuration behavior, Custom Migration is often the cleanest way to avoid compromises that show up later as operational problems.

### Conclusion

The right approach for Square is the one that protects store behavior with the least complexity. Standard is great when data maps cleanly. Managed is safer when your team needs deeper guidance and validation support. Custom is the right choice when preserving meaning requires transformation or special handling.

Run a Demo Migration and use it as evidence for service selection. You can run the Demo Migration yourself, or you can request that Next-Cart run the Demo Migration using your provided sample data and deliver a structured results review.

#### FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I start with Standard and upgrade later if needed?</strong></summary>

Many projects start with a demo-based assumption, then adjust once real complexity is visible. The most efficient path is using a Demo Migration to surface scope early so the project does not rework decisions late.

<summary><strong>What usually triggers Custom Jobs in a Square migration?</strong></summary>

Custom Jobs are usually triggered when business-critical data lives in third-party apps, custom fields, or structures that do not map cleanly into the target platform model.
